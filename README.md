# Convolutional-neural-networks
In this video I show the practical operation of the program I developed to recognize handwritten digits using convolutional neural networks.
The demonstration follows the workflow used in my research project: loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset, applying the CNN architecture implemented in TensorFlow/Keras, and observing how the model processes and classifies the images.
The goal is to illustrate in a clear and direct way how the system works in practice and why convolutional networks are especially effective for image-based tasks.
